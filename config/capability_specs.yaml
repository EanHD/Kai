# Defines strengths, weaknesses, and optimal use cases for local models.
# This helps the orchestrator make intelligent routing decisions and understand
# what each local model can confidently handle.
#
# Format:
# model_id: Matches model ID in models.yaml
# capabilities: What the model can do well
# strengths: Areas where model excels
# weaknesses: Known limitations
# optimal_complexity_range: [min, max] complexity scores where model performs best
# confidence_with_tools: Multiplier for confidence when tools are available
# benchmark_scores: Optional performance metrics

      user_guidance: |
        Granite 4 is designed to be confident with its tools (web search, code execution).
        It should:
        - Proactively use web search for current information
        - Admit when a query needs more powerful reasoning
        - Suggest escalation for complex creative or analytical tasks
        - Be assertive about its strengths (tool integration, factual retrieval)
